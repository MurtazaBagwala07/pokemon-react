                Ash Ketchum is allowed to start his journey in the world of Pokémon and dreams of becoming a Pokémon master, but on the day he is to receive his first Pokémon, Ash oversleeps and wakes up in a panic, running into Gary Oak, who becomes Ash's rival. Professor Oak, the local Pokémon researcher, has already given away the three Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle) he entrusts to new Pokémon Trainers when Ash finally reaches Oak's Lab. The only Pokémon that he has left is a Pikachu, which he gives to Ash. Determined to make it on his journey, Ash does his best to befriend Pikachu, but it refuses to trust him and chooses to stay out of the Poké Ball, even attacking Ash with its electric powers. It is only after Ash protects Pikachu from an angry group of Spearows that Pikachu realizes how much Ash cares. Ash Ketchum has the Thunder Stone, and he wants Pikachu to evolve into Raichu, but Pikachu refuses to evolve.Along the way, Ash makes many human and Pokémon friends as he works his way through the ranks of the world's many Pokémon Leagues. Through the Kanto Region, Ash befriends Water Pokémon trainer and former Cerulean City Gym Leader Misty, and Pokémon Breeder and Pewter City Gym Leader Brock. Together, the three trainers thwart the plans of Jessie, James, and Meowth, low-ranking members of the criminal organization Team Rocket who want to steal Ash's Pikachu and any other rare Pokémon they come across. Giovanni, Team Rocket's Boss introduced three new high-ranking members of Team Rocket; Cassidy, Butch, and Raticate, who want to kidnap Pokémon so they can use their moves.

Ash makes it to the Top 16, but loses to Ritchie in the fifth round. Also, Ritchie loses to Assunta in the sixth round, placing him in the Top 8, and an unknown trainer becomes the winner in the Indigo Conference League because the winner's name was never revealed.And the story goes on...
